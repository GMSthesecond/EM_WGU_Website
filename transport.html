    <p>Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to get out and enjoy the weather, bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). Or just let your own two feet carry you: Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable, and the area surrounding Merriton Landing is easy to explore on foot.</p>
