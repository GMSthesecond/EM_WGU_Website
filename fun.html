    <h1>Fun on the Island</h1>
    <p><b>Things to see</b></p>
    <p>Most tourists spend most of their time in Taniti City, which boasts native architecture and nearby white, sandy beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay. <br>Other popular activities include boat or bus tours of the island, hikes in the rainforest, or visits to Tanitiâ€™s active volcano.</p>
    <p><b>Things to do</b></p>
    <p>Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano. <br>However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, or zip-lining in the rainforest. <br> You might also enjoy visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. <br>Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. <br>Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.</p>
